* About
Typerman is a typing game that is meant to ease the process of learning
touch-typing; a form of typing where the key location are subconsciously
remembered and the person typing does not have to move their eyes away from the
screen.

* Working
The words float down the window. The user must type the words exactly as they
appear in order to earn points and make the word disappear before it falls to
the bottom of the window. Once a word falls to the bottom of the window, the
game ends.

As points increase, so does the difficulty. The difficulty is in both the
frequency of the words and the their length.

* Scope of Improvement
- A cleaner difficulty system which offers choice of difficulty
- Saner user interface that allows:
  - Custom backgrounds
  - Pause game
- A *Game Over* screen that offers two options:
  - Restart Game
  - Quit
